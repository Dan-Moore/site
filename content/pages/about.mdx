## Background

I'm a software developer who got interested in the tech career path during my high school's Cisco's CCNA class and watching MIT OpenCourseWare lectures.
Started out as a networking major, but then migrated over become a software development while in college.

Main motivation to become a Java J2EE developer over being a networking engineer was the lectures by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman.

Started working with python and ruby for during this time.  Besides just learning the syntax, I only used Ruby for coding a static site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
It was a dev blog I started back in college and I haven't touched the language since.

Python was a different story, I started out using it stand-in language instead of LISP when working through SICP.
PyCon conference presentations and reading 'Learn Python the Hard Way' by Zed Shaw helped me pickup the language.
[David Beazley](https://www.dabeaz.com/) talks on generator and co-routines were some of my favorites.
His lectures helped me code a python script for reading and analyzing a windows [MFT file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS#Master_File_Table) for a college project.
