## Background

I'm a software developer who got interested in going into tech as a career path back in my high school's Cisco's CCNA class.  Migrated over to software development while in college.  Besides learning about Java J2EE development and c++ programming, I started picking up python and ruby for personal projects.

Mostly just used ruby for coding a static site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to host a dev blog on github and haven't touched it since.
Python is still a language I still like learn and use.  When I first started out, I enjoyed watching conference presentations hosted by [David Beazley](https://www.dabeaz.com/) on using generator and co-routines for system programmers.  His code samples and slides help me up and running with python.
