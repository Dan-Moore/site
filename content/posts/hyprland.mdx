# Arch Linux with Hyprland
[Hyprland - Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland) is a popular tiling manager that's easy to get started
with by sharing dot files.


Here is [KooL's Arch-Hyprland](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland) dot file, you can install it by running the falling commands.
Once you execute this, Hyprland should be configured, installed and running.
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland.git ~/Arch-Hyprland
cd ~/Arch-Hyprland
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Quick Start on Keybinds
```
(Super/Windows Key) + H - Displays help window with common key binds.
(Super/Windows Key) + Shift + # Window Num - Moves window to new workspace.
(Super/Windows Key) + F - Floats the current window.
```

## Config

Most of the present's will probably require some ricing.  The .config/waybar directory contains a config file for the ui.
```sh
cd ~/.config/waybar
nano config
```
