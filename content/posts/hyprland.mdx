# Arch Linux with Hyprland
[Hyprland - Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland) is a popular tiling manager. Check out [Hyprland's Hall of Fame](https://hyprland.org/hall_of_fame/) for show cases of dot files.

I wanted a dot file pre-configured with oh-my-zsh started working off of
[KooL's Arch-Hyprland](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland) public dot file.


Running this command will configure and install hypHyprlandrland for an arch machine.
```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland.git ~/Arch-Hyprland
cd ~/Arch-Hyprland
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Quick Start on Keybinds
```
(Super/Windows Key) + H - Displays help window with common key binds.
(Super/Windows Key) + Shift + # Window Num - Moves window to new workspace.
(Super/Windows Key) + F - Floats the current window.
(Super/Windows Key) + Q - Closes the current window.

```

## Waybar Config
The Waybar is the menu bar of Hyprland, you can edit the config with this command.
```sh
cd ~/.config/waybar
nano config
```

## ZSH Config

By default, this dot file with oh-my-zsh pre-configured.  There are also script for generating pokemon ascii art in the terminal.  You can turn it off by removing this line in .zshrc

```sh
# Display Pokemon-colorscripts
# Project page: https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts#on-other-distros-and-macos
pokemon-colorscripts --no-title -s -r

```
