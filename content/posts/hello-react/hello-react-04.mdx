# RSS Feed
This project uses the [RSS](https://github.com/dylang/node-rss) libary to generate a feed.

The can be added to the package manager with the following command:
```sh
pnpm add rss
```

Within the /app directory, I created a folder called [rss.xml].  In my use case, the folder name will become both the url path and the .xml file name.

In the newly created folder, make a route.tsx file, with the following code.  It's doing something similar to what we did in the sitemap.xml file.
I'm grabbing all the posts objects generated by contentlayer and making a simple RSS feed with them.
```tsx
import { allPosts } from "@/.contentlayer/generated"
import '@next/env'
import RSS from 'rss';


const feed = new RSS({
  // Feed Options
  title: 'Software Development - Daniel Moore',
  description: 'Hello World! Welcome my website.',
  site_url: `${process.env.RSS_SITE_URL}`,
  feed_url: `${process.env.RSS_FEED_URL}`,
  copyright: `${new Date().getFullYear()} Daniel Moore`,
  language: 'en',
  pubDate: new Date(),
});


export async function GET() {
  const posts = allPosts
  .map((post) => ({
    title: post.title,
    description: post.description,
    url: `${process.env.SITE_MAP_URL}${post.slug}`,
    pubDate: post.modified_date || post.published_date,
  }))

  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify(posts),
    {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
      },
    }
  );
}
```
