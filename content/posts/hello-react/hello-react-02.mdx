# Site Design on Pages and Posts
Created links to [Pages](/pages), [Series](/series), and [Posts](/posts) in the web page header.

TODO: web pages are still wip.  I'll circle back here later
## ContentLayer Scheme
Post and Pages objects internal fields are nearly identical, only minor differance is that posts have a 'series' field and pages has a 'topics'

1. series
    > Series display name. This field is needed when working with posts contained in an internal folder in the /content/posts/ directory.
2. topics
    > Subject topics the page write-up is covering.
3. published_date
    > Date of publication.  Can be a future date, in such cases it act's like the post is in draft status.
4. modified_date
    > Date of the last edit made to the page.  Hard coded atm, not sure how if I can populate it dynamically with the last commit time stamp.
5. hide_rss
    > Boolean flag to hide a post or page from the RSS feed.  Made this variable for hiding [About](/about) from the out going feed.
6. draft
    > Boolean flag to prevent the page from being published and displayed on the site.
```tsx
export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Post",
  filePathPattern: `posts/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: "mdx",
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
    description: {
      type: "string",
    },
    series: {
      type: "string",
    },
    published_date: {
      type: "date",
    },
    modified_date: {
      type: "date",
    },
    hide_rss: {
      type: "boolean",
    },
    draft: {
      type: "boolean",
    },
  },
  computedFields,
}))
```

## Pages
For now, I'm only returning a feed of all published pages.
There isn't much content beside some lorem ipsum pages, still need to figure out how I want to design and display any write-ups.
```tsx
import { allPages } from "@/.contentlayer/generated"
import Link from "next/link"

export default function Pages() {
    const found_topics = [];
  return (
    <div className="prose dark:prose-invert">
      {allPages
          .filter((post) => !post.draft && post.title != 'About')
          .map((page) => (
        <article key={page._id}>
          <Link href={page.slug}>
            <h2>{page.title}</h2>
          </Link>
          {page.description && <p>{page.description}</p>}
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Posts
Similar to Pages, but this page will probably just be a feed of all published blog posts.  Need to add pagenation and a few other QOL features.

```tsx
import { allPosts } from "@/.contentlayer/generated"
import Link from "next/link"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="prose dark:prose-invert">
      {allPosts
          .filter((post) => !post.draft)
          .map((post) => (
        <article key={post._id}>
          <Link href={post.slug}>
            <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          </Link>
          {post.description && <p>{post.description}</p>}
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Series
The series page is similar to the posts page, but just limits output to the first blog post of any given series.
```tsx
import { allPosts } from "@/.contentlayer/generated"
import Link from "next/link"

export default function Home() {
    const found = []
  return (
    <div className="prose dark:prose-invert">
      {allPosts
          .filter((post) => {
              const isSeries = (post.series !== undefined);

              if(!found.includes(post.series) && isSeries){
                  found.push(post.series);
                  return true;
              }

           return !post.draft && isSeries && !found.includes(post.series)
           })
          .map((post) => (
        <article key={post._id}>
          <Link href={post.slug}>
            <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          </Link>
          {post.description && <p>{post.description}</p>}
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```
