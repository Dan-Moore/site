# Site Design
Most of my design decisions will be focused around how I use [contentlayer.config.js](https://github.com/Dan-Moore/site/blob/main/contentlayer.config.js).
This config file contains the scheme files for the objects and the directory path to run a scan.  

With a single import, a collection of posts objects based on the .MDX files in the '/content/posts/' directory.
```tsx
import { allPosts } from "@/.contentlayer/generated"
```

## Page and Post Objects
MDX files stored within '/content/pages' and '/content/posts' directories will be generated as either a Page or Post object. 

The body of the .MDX file can be passed into the server component with this command:
```tsx
<Mdx code={post.body.code} />
```

### Pages
Pages are stand alone write-ups that fall outside of being a blog posts.
If the page is located within a nested directory, the inner folder becomes a topic associated with the page.

```tsx
/**
 * Page object created from .mdx file found within the '/pages' directory. 
 */
export const Page = defineDocumentType(() => ({
/**
 * Shared fields used between Pages and Post objects.
 */
const globals = {
  /**
   * Title of the <Page|Post>.
   */
  title: {
    type: "string",
    required: true,
  },
  /**
   * Brief description of the <Page|Post>. 
   */
  description: {type: "string",},
  /**
   * Status of the <Page|Post>
   *  - draft: <Page|Post> is still being worked on and not set for publication
   *  - publish: <Page|Post> is set to be published
   *  - hide: <Page|Post> is set to be hidden on the RSS feed.
   */
  status: {
    type: "enum",
    options: ["draft", "publish", "hide"],
    default: "draft"
  },
  /**
   * Keywords tags associated with the <Page|Post>.
   */
  tags: { 
    type: 'list', 
    of: { type: 'string' }, 
    default: [] 
  },
  /**
   * Date of publication. Future dates are accepted, but will block publishing the <Page|Post>.
   */
  published_date: {
    type: "date",
    default: new Date().toLocaleDateString(),
  },
  /**
   * Date of last modification.  Tracks the last edit on a <Page|Post> .
   */
  modified_date: {
    type: "date",
    default: new Date().toLocaleDateString(),
  },
}

/**
 * Page object created from .mdx file found within the '/pages' directory. 
 */
export const Page = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Page",
  filePathPattern: `pages/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: "mdx",
  fields: globals,
  computedFields,
}))
```

### Post
Blog posts can be grouped together in a series, or a singular blog post.
```tsx
/**
 * Post object created from .mdx file found within the '/posts' directory. 
 * Posts can be grouped together into a series.
 */
export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Post",
  filePathPattern: `posts/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: "mdx",
  // Using the spread operator to merge in the global fields.
  fields: {...{
    /**
     * Title of the series
     */
    series_title: {type: "string",},
    /**
     * Brief description of the Series
     */
    series_description: {type: "string",},
    
    /**
     * Series Index - Number of where the Post falls in the series 
     */
    series_index:{
      type: "number",
      default: 0,
    },

  }, ...globals },
  computedFields,
}))
```



## ContentLayer Field Descriptions
Page and Post is my two main objects and they share many of the same fields.
Field values can be assigned in the header of the .mdx files

```mdx

## Post and Page Utility Class
Re-usable functions for Post and Page objects are exposed in '/components/contentlayer-util.tsx' 
```tsx
/**
* Checks if the given article set in draft mode and if the given published date is in the future. 
* @param content Either Post or Page 
* @returns boolean
*/
export function isPublished(content: Post | Page) {
    if(content.status === "draft"){ 
      return false; 
    }

    // published_date is in iso format.  
    // Making new date obj for current date comparison.
    if(content.published_date !== undefined && new Date(content.published_date) > new Date()) {
      return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```
