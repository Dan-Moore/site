# Implementing Environment Variables
The template is barebones and a couple of steps are needed for creating server and client side environment variables.

First, we will need a .env file on the root directory.  It's a simple configuratin file where the entries are key-value pairs with an '=' operator for value assignment.

```
# Site Map Variables
SITE_MAP_URL=https://daniel-moore.net

# RSS Feed Variables
RSS_SITE_TITLE=Daniel Moore
RSS_SITE_DESCRIPTION=Software Development Blog
RSS_SITE_URL=https://daniel-moore.net
RSS_FEED_URL=https://daniel-moore.net/rss.xml
```

Next we will need an envConfig.tsx file created in the /app directory.
```tsx
import { loadEnvConfig } from '@next/env'
 
const projectDir = process.cwd()
loadEnvConfig(projectDir)
```

Now we should all set to start using the environment variables on the server side.  
Snippet below shows a simple use case on how to write the import and use the environment variable defined in the .env file.
```tsx
import '@next/env'

const url = process.env.SITE_MAP_URL
```

Client side environments need to be defined in the next.config.js file in the root directory.
```js
const { withContentlayer } = require("next-contentlayer");

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  env: {
    foo: 'bar',
  }
};

module.exports = withContentlayer(nextConfig);
```
