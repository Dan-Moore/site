# Site Design
Most of my design decisions will be by around how I use [contentlayer.config.js](https://github.com/Dan-Moore/site/blob/main/contentlayer.config.js).
This config file contains the scheme files for the objects and defines what my project's objects and defines how I use them.

## ContentLayer Field Descriptions
Page and Post is my two main objects and they share many of the same fields.
Field values can be assigned in the header of the .mdx files

```

1. series
    > Series display name. This field is needed when working with posts contained in an internal folder in the /content/posts/ directory.
2. topics
    > Subject topics the page write-up is covering.
3. published_date
    > Date of publication.  Can be a future date, in such cases it act's like the post is in draft status.
4. modified_date
    > Date of the last edit made to the page.  Hard coded atm, not sure how if I can populate it dynamically with the last commit time stamp.
5. hide_rss
    > Boolean flag to hide a post or page from the RSS feed.  Made this variable for hiding [About](/about) from the out going feed.
6. draft
    > Boolean flag to prevent the page from being published and displayed on the site.

### Scheme
```tsx
export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Post",
  filePathPattern: `posts/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: "mdx",
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
    description: {
      type: "string",
    },
    series: {
      type: "string",
    },
    published_date: {
      type: "date",
    },
    modified_date: {
      type: "date",
    },
    hide_rss: {
      type: "boolean",
    },
    draft: {
      type: "boolean",
    },
  },
  computedFields,
}))
```
