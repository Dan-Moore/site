# Hello React!
This website is hosted on Github Pages and makes use of GitHub Actions for automated build and deployments.

[Shadcn's Next-ContentLayer](https://github.com/shadcn/next-contentlayer) is a skeleton project that's pre-configured with ContentLayer to use .mdx files.  Main benefit is using this template is for creating a static site that's written in markdown.


## Migrating to NPM
I ran into some issues with deploying the application with the pnpm package manager that comes with repo by default.

Switching back to npm is pretty straight forward.
1. Delete node_modules directory
2. Delete pnpm_lock.yaml
3. Review package.json or any other script file makes reference to pnpm and update with npm
4. Run npm install


## Creating a Workflow for GitHub Actions
With GitHub Actions we can setup CI/CD pipeline and making one is a breeze.  There is a built-in tool to scan the repository and
generate a workflow file based on what tech stack you used.  In this case, the tool created a workflow file for a .Next.js application.

While on the Github, navigate to the settings tab for the repository that you want deploy.

Change the Source to 'GitHub Actions'.  After you make the change, a scan will take place and a workflow will be created for the project.

Review the generated workflow file.  I had to make an edit within the 'Setup Pages' action in the build process.
This action had a 'with' statement that was breaking the build process.
```yml
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
```
