# Hello React!
This website is hosted on Github Pages and makes use of GitHub Actions for automated build and deployments.

I've used [Shadcn's Next-ContentLayer Template](https://github.com/shadcn/next-contentlayer) as skeleton project to build upon.
It comes as a bare bone static site that's preconfigured with ContentLayer to work with .mdx files.  Letting me to created
and maintain web pages purely in markdown.

I ran into some issues with deploying the application with the pnpm package manager that comes with template by default and reverted to npm.

## Migrating to NPM
By default, the template bundled with pnpm as the package manager.
Switching back to npm is pretty straight forward.
1. Delete node_modules directory
2. Delete pnpm_lock.yaml
3. Review package.json or any other script file makes reference to pnpm and update with npm

With working with the template dependencies, I triggered a dependency conflict breaking the npm install & update commands.
```sh
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error
npm error While resolving: next-contentlayer@0.1.0
npm error Found: next@14.2.14
npm error node_modules/next
npm error   next@"^14.2.14" from the root project
npm error
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer next@"^12 || ^13" from next-contentlayer@0.3.4
npm error node_modules/next-contentlayer
npm error   next-contentlayer@"^0.3.2" from the root project
npm error
npm error Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
npm error this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
npm error to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
npm error
npm error
npm error For a full report see:
npm error <local_path>/.npm/_logs/2024-10-06T16_32_46_807Z-eresolve-report.txt
npm error A complete log of this run can be found in: <local_path>/.npm/_logs/2024-10-06T16_32_46_807Z-debug-0.log
```

This line of the stack trace gives a optional tag to use with the CLI command to make it work.
```sh
npm error Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
npm error this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
```

As workaround to avoid having to use it as CLI optional argument, I updated the npm config to force legacy-peer-deps to always be true.

```sh
npm config set legacy-peer-deps true
```

## Creating a Workflow for GitHub Actions
With GitHub Actions we can setup CI/CD pipeline and making one is a breeze.  There is a built-in tool to scan the repository and
generate a workflow file based on what tech stack you used.  In this case, the tool created a workflow file for a .Next.js application.

While on the Github, navigate to the settings tab for the repository that you want deploy.

Change the Source to 'GitHub Actions'.  After you make the change, a scan will take place and a workflow will be created for the project.

Review the generated workflow file.  I had to make an edit within the 'Setup Pages' action in the build process.
This action had a 'with' statement that was breaking the build process.
```yml
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
```
