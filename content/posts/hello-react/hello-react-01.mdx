# Hello React!
This website is hosted on Github Pages and makes use of GitHub Actions for automated build and deployments.

I've used [Shadcn's Next-ContentLayer Template](https://github.com/shadcn/next-contentlayer) as skeleton project to build upon.
It comes as a bare bone static site that's preconfigured with ContentLayer to work with .mdx files.  Letting me to created
and maintain web pages purely in markdown.

I ran into some issues with deploying the application with the pnpm package manager that comes with template by default and reverted to npm.


## Creating a Workflow for GitHub Actions
With GitHub Actions we can setup CI/CD pipeline and making one is a breeze.  There is a built-in tool to scan the repository and
generate a workflow file based on what tech stack you used.  In this case, the tool created a workflow file for a .Next.js application.

While on the Github, navigate to the settings tab for the repository that you want deploy.

Change the Source to 'GitHub Actions'. After you make the change, a scan will take place and a workflow will be created for the project.

Review the generated workflow file, we will need to make an edit the 'Setup Pages' action in the build process.  I had to
remove with statement it comes with by default.  Works fine without it.
```yml
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
```
