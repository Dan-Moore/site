# Hello React!
This website is hosted on Github Pages and makes use of GitHub Actions for automated build and deployments.

[Shadcn's Next-ContentLayer](https://github.com/shadcn/next-contentlayer) is a skeleton project that's pre-configured with ContentLayer to use .mdx files.  Main benefit of this template, is that I can start writing content markdown while develop features for this static site.


## Migrating to NPM
I ran into some issues with deploying the application with the pnpm package manager that comes with repo by default.

Switching back to npm is pretty straight forward.
1. Delete node_modules directory
2. Delete pnpm_lock.yaml
3. Review package.json or any other script file makes reference to pnpm and update with npm
4. Run npm install


## Creating a Workflow for GitHub Actions
With GitHub Actions, we can setup CI/CD pipeline and making one is a breeze.  There is a built-in tool that scans the repo and then generates a workflow file for you.  

Open up the settings page for your github repo you want create a workflow file. 
Navigate to the Page section, and change the source to 'GitHub Actions'.  After you make the change, a scan will take place and a workflow will be created for the project.

Review the generated workflow file.  I had to make an edit within the 'Setup Pages' action in the build process.
This action had a 'with' statement that was breaking the build process.
```yml
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
```
